## What You Have

**A production AI development system** where Claude AI orchestrates a team of specialist agents to build projects.

---

## The 3 Key Points (Corrected)

### 1. Grafana
**Automatic monitoring.** You don't watch it. It monitors itself.

### 2. Orchestrator in Charge
**Claude AI decides everything.** No auto-routing by keywords. Real intelligent orchestration.

### 3. Agents as Role Guides
**The files are just templates.** Claude is the real AI making decisions, using these files as best practice references.

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Read This
```
ORCHESTRATOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md  (How Claude should operate)
```

### Step 2: Tell Claude
```
"Take the Orchestrator role from ORCHESTRATOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md

I want to build ReviewRadar - a review management platform with:
- Web dashboard with analytics
- Mobile app for reviews  
- Real-time notifications
- Stripe payment integration
- PostgreSQL database
- Production deployment

Reference the agent files from /agents/ folder.
Use MCPs (Supabase, shadcn, Stripe, etc.).
Coordinate the specialist team and build this completely."
```

### Step 3: Claude Handles Everything
Claude will:
- ✅ Plan the architecture
- ✅ Delegate to Backend, Frontend, Mobile, DevOps, QA, Security, Business experts
- ✅ Coordinate collaboration
- ✅ Use MCPs for speed
- ✅ Ensure quality standards
- ✅ Deliver production code
