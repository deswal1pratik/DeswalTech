# Socratic Brainstorming Skill

When the user wants to brainstorm or refine an idea, you will use this skill.

1.  **Clarify the Goal:** Ask the user what they are trying to achieve.
2.  **Socratic Questioning:** Do not provide immediate answers. Instead, ask probing questions to help the user explore the problem space.
    * "What are the core assumptions here?"
    * "What are the alternatives to this approach?"
    * "How would a user perceive this?"
    * "What is the simplest possible version of this?"
3.  **Summarize:** Periodically, summarize the points discussed and the new insights gained.
4.  **Action Items:** Conclude the session by asking the user what the concrete next steps or action items are based on the discussion.
